                    if there is one thing that you should know about me,
                    it's that I love sunsets and I love my club.<br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.hackuci.com/">HackUCI</a> is 
                    happening this weekend and I'm super proud to be
                    part of it !!! <br><br>

                    Day 1:<br>
                    &gt I stayed up until 5 working on a puzzle with the hack bbs. :) <br>
                    &gt The start of hackathon was pretty stressful but things are going smoothly atm... I think <br>
                    &gt Today is not the day for imposter syndrome !<br><br>

                    Day 2:<br>
                    &gt Had back to back socials and was tiring but super fun ! 
                    No one showed up to the icebreaker event (one person 
                    did, but they left; goes to show maybe ppl don't really want 
                    to socialize in that way?? at a hackathon?) We had a good 
                    time hanging out with the orgs tho! I love them all &lbrack3.<br>
                    &gt Played club penguin with some peeps on the discord which was
                    so fun :pleading_face: I love these people.<br><br>

                    Day 3:<br>
                    &gt Barely participated in the event today because I had to work
                    on the web crawler with the spider bois &rbrack&lbrack but we 
                    finished to that's nice. 
                    &gt What the heck is the Wolfram subscription about??? <br><br>

                    That concludes my second virtual(and non-virtual) hackathon that
                    I had the opportunity to help plan! Feels like I didn't do much/
                    enough, event though I was doing what I could. :( Also I need to 
                    somehow work faster bc if I do my job slow, someone might just do
                    it for me and then it'll be ;-; when I finish and it's too late.
